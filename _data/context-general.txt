## General Context

When choosing a template to use in the General Context, the Carrington engine looks at the type of request is being fulfilled. It will identify the request as the home page, a category archive, and individual post, etc.

There is additional checking done for single post requests. All options in the Content Context are supported here with a 'single-' prefix added to the file. See specifics below.

A "default" template is required, and will be used when there are no other templates that match a given comment. This could be because no other templates have been created, or because the comment in question doesn't match the templates that are available.

By default, supported template conditions are checked in this order:

1. author
2. category
3. taxonomy
4. tag
5. type
6. role
7. single
8. default (home, search, archive, 404, etc.)

This can be altered using the `cfct_general_match_order` hook.
