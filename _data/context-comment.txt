## Comment Context

When choosing a template to use in the Comment Context, the Carrington engine looks at the type of comment and the author of the comment to choose which template to use.

A "default" template is required, and will be used when there are no other templates that match a given comment. This could be because no other templates have been created, or because the comment in question doesn't match the templates that are available.

The order in which these conditions are checked defaults to the following supported templates:

1. ping
2. author
3. user
4. meta
6. role
7. default
	
This order can be overridden with a plugin using the `cfct_comment_match_order` hook.

Once a template match has been found, no other processing is done.


### Supported Templates (Comment Context)

- *ping.php* - Used if the comment is a pingback or a trackback.
- *author.php* - Used when the author of the post leaves a comment.
- *user-{username}.php* - Used when a user with that username leaves a comment. For example, a template with a file name of _user-jsmith.php_ would be used for a comment by user _jsmith_. Any WordPres username can take the place of {username} in the file name.
- *meta-{key}-{value}.php* - Used when there is a custom field for the comment matching the key and value listed in the file name. This is useful if you want to be able to flag comments as "voted" (someone voting the post up or down) or similar, and give those posts some custom treatment. In this example, you could add a custom field of "voted" with a value of "up" or "down" with their comment and it would use a template of <code>meta-voted-up.php</code> or <code>meta-voted-down.php</code> if that template exists.
- *meta-{key}.php* - Used when there is a custom field for the comment matching the key listed in the file name. This is useful if you want to be able to flag comments as "tweetbacks" or similar, and give those posts some custom treatment. In this example, you could add a custom field of "tweetback" with a value of the URL of the Tweet and it would use a template of <code>meta-tweetback.php</code> if that template exists. The value does not matter in this match.
- *role-{role}.php* - Used when a comment is made by a user with a certain role. For example, a template with a file name of _role-subscriber.php_ would be used for a user with a role of "subscriber" (typical for a registered commentor who is not an author or an admin). Any WordPress role can take the place of {role} in the file name.
- *comment-default.php* - Used when there are no other templates that match for a given comment.
