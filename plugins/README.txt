Carrington supports plugins in the same conceptual manner as WordPress. Carrington includes several hooks and filters so you can customize/override Carrington's default behavior.

Any .php files placed in this directory will be auto-loaded and processed by Carrington.

This is the recommended way to interact with the hooks and filters provided by Carrington so that they can be easily distributed with the theme.
