## comment/

### Overview

This directory holds templates for displaying a comment in it's entirety. These templates do not hold the comment loop, or the "Comments" title or the form to allow commenting; they just show a single comment.

Typically these templates will be brought in to a template in _comments/_, but can also be used to display single comments as needed.
