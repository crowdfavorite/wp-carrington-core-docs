## footer/

The standard _footer.php_ file (included using the WordPress `get_footer()` function) in Carrington is set up to call the `cfct_footer()` function, which will choose the appropriate footer file from this directory - based on the context of the given page. This can be useful if you want to have pages to have a custom footer, or perhaps a certain category to have a custom footer.
